Title: Exploratory Analysis and Machine Learning for Loan Status Prediction using Python

Abstract: This research project focuses on the development of an accurate loan status prediction model using Python. The study incorporates several techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), comprehensive data preprocessing (including cleaning, data standardizing, data transformation, feature engineering, and data splitting), and the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm to assess the model's predictive performance.

The prediction model considers a set of carefully selected variables, namely 'principal', 'terms', 'effective_date', 'due_date', 'education', 'gender', 'age', and 'loan_status'. These variables are pivotal in evaluating the risk and likelihood of successful loan repayment.

The experimental results demonstrate a promising prediction accuracy of approximately 98% in loan status classification.

However, it is important to note that this study is based on a relatively small dataset comprising 346 rows and 10 columns. For larger datasets, it is highly recommended to conduct further investigation into variable relationships and employ advanced data modeling techniques to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of the prediction model.
